NOTE AS OF 2012-08-01: This is forked from mmitton's original to apply
a year-old pull request and get it working with Go 1.0. 

I have no intention of actively developing this library, but I will
actually apply pull-requests. 

If you are interested in taking over active development (I'm assuming
mmitton has abandoned it), let me know and I'll take this down and
point people your way.
